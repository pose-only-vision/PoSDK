<!--
- **Data Format**: Usually provides matching point coordinates, ground truth inlier/outlier labels, ground truth essential matrix/fundamental matrix.
- **Usage in PoSDK**: How to load this data and input it into PoSDK's two-view estimation algorithms (such as `two_view_estimator` with different robust methods like `method_robustLiRP`, etc.).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: How to evaluate PoSDK method performance according to challenge evaluation standards (e.g., calculating accuracy based on estimated essential matrix/fundamental matrix, or based on inlier/outlier classification accuracy).
